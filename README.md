# Matching-LianLianKan
## __Introduction__
### __Algorithm__
This is an auto-complete of the LianLianKan. For the solving algorithm, I designed it completely on my own. For the Window-to-matrix algorithm, I used some helps from the reference link below.

### __Story and Game__
LianLianKan is a matching game what I used to play when I was little. I remember playing it on my Dad's push-button phone. Then I realized that you can also play it on computers. To play it, all you need is to find two matching images and connect them by clicking them. A valid connection is when there is a valid path between the two images. A valid path is getting from one to another using at most two corners. You want to clear out all the images to win.

## __How to Use__
1. Download the program and the game. Links are in the reference.
2. Start the game by clicking "练习 (Practice)".
3. Run the run.py (Make sure to not switch window and move the mouse until the program finished).

## __Note__
Make sure to not use the script in multi-player mode.

There is an mp4 file which contains a video of the game and the program. The first half is me trying the game. The second half is the script.
